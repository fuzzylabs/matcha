## 🎬 Getting started

Contributions are made to this project using Issues and Pull Request (PRs). Before creating your own, search for existing Issues and PRs - as I'm sure you're aware, this removes duplication and makes everyones life easier!

### 😭 Issues

Issues should be used to report bugs with `matcha`, proposing new features before a PR is raised, and to request new features. We're making use of templates to make this process easier for you and consistent for everyone - this will appear whne you create an issue.

If you find an issue that has already been reported by another good samaritan, then please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Reacting to issues can also help our maintainers understand that the issue is affecting more than one reporter.
