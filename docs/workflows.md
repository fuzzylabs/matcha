# :building_construction: MLOps Workflows

Matcha is a tool for provisioning MLOps environments to the cloud and to give you some examples of how to use `matcha` in a practical setting, we've created a set of example workflows.

You can find them [here](https://github.com/fuzzylabs/matcha-examples).

Before you dive into the example workflows, you'll need to ensure that you have an Azure account with the correct level of permissions to deploy resources. We've created a guide on this, which can you can find [here](azure-permissions.md).

The repository currently contains the following examples:

1. [Movie Recommendation](https://github.com/fuzzylabs/matcha-examples/tree/main/recommendation).
2. [Legal text summarisation using LLMs](https://github.com/fuzzylabs/matcha-examples/tree/main/llm).
