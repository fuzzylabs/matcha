# Resource Stacks ðŸ“š

Machine Learning projects often vary in their size, from small-scale experimentation to large deployments, meaning that the infrastructure requirements also change and scale. For example, the infrastructure stack needed for deploying an LLM may require a GPU or vector database, which aren't usually needed in more general machine learning use-cases.

Matcha accommodates both of these requirements, and currently offers two infrastructure stacks which we'll discuss in more detail here and show how you can get started with either.

> Note: These stacks must be set before provisioning any resources and cannot currently be change whilst a deployed.

## Available stacks

### DEFAULT

The `DEFAULT` stack. This stack is ideal for generic machine learning training and deployments and a good starting point. It includes:
   * [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/products/kubernetes-service)
   * [ZenML](https://www.zenml.io/home)
   * [Seldon Core](https://www.seldon.io/solutions/open-source-projects/core) (deployment)
   * [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) (experiment tracking)
   * [Data Version Control](https://dvc.org/) storage


### LLM

The `LLM` stack: This includes everything found within the `DEFAULT` stack with the addition of a vector database - Chroma DB. This stack is modified for the training and deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs).

   * [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/products/kubernetes-service)
   * [ZenML](https://www.zenml.io/home)
   * [Seldon Core](https://www.seldon.io/solutions/open-source-projects/core) (deployment)
   * [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) (experiment tracking)
   * [Data Version Control](https://dvc.org/) storage
   * [Chroma DB](https://www.trychroma.com/) (vector database for document retrieval)

## How to switch your stack

To switch your stack to the 'DEFAULT' stack, run the following command:

```bash
$ matcha stack set default
```

or for the 'LLM' stack:

```bash
$ matcha stack set llm
```

If no stack is set Matcha will use the 'default' stack.
