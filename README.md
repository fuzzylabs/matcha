# `matcha` :tea:

Welcome to `matcha`, the open source tool for efficiently and effectively provisioning MLOps environments to the cloud.

Building your own MLOps environment by selecting and combining individual open source tools, along with hooking up those provisioned tools to your ML workflow, is time consuming.

`matcha` seeks to change this, and we want to provide our users with the ability to:

* Quickly get up and running with an MLOps environment where models can be trained and deployed, using only open source technologies.
* Efficiently link your provisioned MLOps environment to your ML workflow.

By default, `matcha` will provision an MLOps environment to Azure with sensible defaults - enough for you to get going with cloud-based training and deployment.
