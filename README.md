# `matcha` :tea:

Welcome to `matcha`, the open source tool for provisioning MLOps environments to the cloud.

Data Scientists and practitioners build ML pipelines and productionize them with the following capabilities:

* A way to run model training pipelines
* A way to track experiments
* A way to deploy and serve models

There are other capabilities, such as model monitoring, but as a starting point the above would enable a Data Scientist to train, track, and deploy models in the cloud. Having an environment for setting these up is difficult and time consuming.

`matcha` uses open source to solve this problem in an elegant way.

By default, `matcha` will `provision` an MLOps environment to Azure with sensible defaults - enough for you to get going with cloud-based training and deployment. From there, you can use `matcha` to `get` information about your provisioned environment.

Please see the following for more information, including install instructions, documentation, and how you can contribute to `matcha`:
