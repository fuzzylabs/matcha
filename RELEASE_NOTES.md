# 0.2.1

In this release, we introduce `matcha` to the world - an open source tool for provisioning MLOps environments to the cloud.

With this alpha release of `matcha`, you can provision the infrastructure necessary to enable the following capabilities:

- A way to run model training pipelines
- A way to track experiments
- A way to deploy and serve models

This an alpha version of `matcha` and we're continually working on improvements and adding new features. If you run into any issues, then please report them as [issues](https://github.com/fuzzylabs/matcha/issues) - we really appreciate any feedback.

**How to get started**

To demonstrate practical ways in which you can get started with using `matcha`, see our [workflow examples](https://github.com/fuzzylabs/matcha-examples). Our [documentation](https://fuzzylabs.github.io/matcha/) also provides more information on how `matcha` works, what Azure permissions you need, and much more.

You can install `matcha` using `pip`:

```bash
pip install matcha-ml
```

We hope you enjoy using `matcha` and stay tuned for the next release!
